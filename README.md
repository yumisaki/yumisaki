# Ayumi Sakiyama - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

I'm an experienced marketing professional currently residing in Renton, WA looking to transition into the analytics field. For the first few years out of college I taught English to kids in Korea while learning a new language and traveling Asia. During that time I developed an interest in research and pivoted my career to marketing where I was able to harness my skills in conducting market research for my employer.
