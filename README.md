# Ayumi Sakiyama - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

I'm an experienced marketing professional currently residing in Renton, WA looking to transition into the analytics field. For the first few years out of college, I taught English to 3-6th graders in Korea, tutored kids with disabilities, and worked in a clinic for children with autism. During that time I developed an interest in research and pivoted my career to marketing where I was able to harness my skills in conducting market research for my employer.
